            <p>NovaBrush is an experiment of some sorts. I'm doing this project as a "journey" so I can understand how software works in general, while at the same time, learning how to built it by myself.
                I intend this to be a lightweight, responsible image editor built with C#. I really like programs that are instant, native and fast. Like ShareX and LibreOffice. I know Electron is used in the current era, but I prefer programs that have less bloat or delay, just click... and it's there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes, as of today, this little project is only 2.85MBs. There are no frameworks or advanced libs. Just code and XAML. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why Modular?</h2>
        <p>
            Now, sometimes I ask myself: "Why not just develop the image editor all at once?"
            Because, honestly, I think it's overwhelming to do everything all at once, there's the risk of it turning into spaghetti code and then there's scope creep. I prefer doing it on small victory and decisions instead!
            I'm developing one "microproject" at a time. One project will do layers, one project will do filters, one project will do the UI and so on. 

            As of today, NovaBrush can:
        </p>

        <li>
            Generate an empty canvas
        </li>

        <li>
            Zoom (Ctrl + Wheel)
        </li>

        <li>
            Pan (Middle Mouse)
        </li>

        <li>
            Open PNG Files
        </li>

        <li>
            Check if same said files are valid
        </li>

        <p>
            I'm using them as self-contained experiments, or puzzles to solve. Kinda like Legos. I'm also using Obsidian to get track of why something works and how everything intracts together. 
            If possible, I can go back to old microprojects and add new functionalities that weren't in there before, like a smoother zooming or even hotkeys. 
        </p>

        <p>
            That keeps me going, and I think it shows <b>growth</b> as well.
        </p>

        <p>
            The point of this project basically is. If I can learn zooming, panning, and image loading from scratch... I can certainly learn React, state management, or even more complex UIs that respond to users.
